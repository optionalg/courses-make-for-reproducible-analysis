title                : Make for Reproducible Analysis
description          : Make is a tool that can keep track of which files depend
  on which others, and update ones that have fallen out of date.  While it was
  originally invented to help prorammers compile complex programs, data analysts
  now use it to ensure that their work is reproducible.  This lesson will introduce
  key elements of Make and show you how to use them efficiently.
